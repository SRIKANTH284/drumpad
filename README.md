- **Interactive Buttons**: Drum pads highlight when pressed, either via the keyboard or mouse click.
- **Audio Playback**: Each pad plays a unique sound using the freeCodeCamp drum sounds collection.
- **Recording Display**: Displays the last sound played on the screen.
- **Smooth Animations**: Drum pads scale down when pressed and reset after a short delay.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used for handling events and controlling audio playback.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the app. Includes responsive design to make the app work on multiple screen sizes.
- **Font Awesome**: For the GitHub icon.

   - **Click on the drum pads** using your mouse to play the sound.
   - **Press the corresponding keys** on your keyboard (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C) to play the sound.
3. The name of the sound you played will be displayed in the "Drum Machine" display section.
